		<h2>What is AmeriCorps NCCC?</h2>
		<p>AmeriCorps NCCC is a full-time, team-based residential program for men and women age 18-24. Members are assigned to one of five campuses — Denver, CO; Sacramento, CA; Perry Point, MD; Vicksburg, MS; and Vinton, IA.</p>
		<p>AmeriCorps NCCC (National Civilian Community Corps)  strengthens communities and develops leaders through direct, team-based national and community service. In partnership with non-profits—secular and faith based—local municipalities, state governments, federal government, national and state parks, Indian tribes, and schools, members complete service projects throughout the region they are assigned.</p>

		<p>Drawn from the successful models of the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s and the U.S. military, AmeriCorps NCCC is built on the belief that civic responsibility is an inherent duty of all citizens and that national service programs work effectively with local communities to address pressing needs.</p>
		<p>AmeriCorps NCCC serves communities in every state.  Sponsoring organizations request the assistance of AmeriCorps NCCC teams by submitting a project application to the regional campus that covers that organization’s state. The campuses provide assistance in completing the application, developing a work plan, and preparing the project sponsor for the arrival of the AmeriCorps NCCC team.</p>

		<h2>How do I join NCCC?</h2>
		<p>AmeriCorps NCCC members serve for a 10-month commitment in teams of 8 to 12 and are assigned to projects throughout the region served by their campus. They are trained in CPR, first aid, public safety, and other skills before beginning their first service project. Members are based at one of five regional campuses and travel to complete service projects throughout those regions.</p>

		<p>To strengthen the nation’s disaster response capacity, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Corporation for National and Community Service have established FEMA Corps, a unit of 1,600 service corps members within AmeriCorps NCCC solely devoted to disaster preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.</p>
		<p>This innovative partnership builds on the historic collaboration between the two agencies and enhances the federal government’s disaster capabilities, increase the reliability and diversity of the disaster workforce, promote an ethic of service, expand education and economic opportunity for young people, and achieve an estimated cost savings of more than $350 million in the first five years. </p>
